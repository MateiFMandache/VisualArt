# VisualArt
Computer programs that generate visually appealing images

To run these programs, you will need to install graphics.py as follows:

    pip install graphics.py

Here is a description of each artwork:
- car simulates a car that drives around at random on a dark surface and leaves a paint trail
- map produces contour lines for a randomly selected terrain
- sunflower looks like a sunflower. It is based on the [golden ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio)
- mountains is based on random walks. This produces a visual aspect reminiscent of stock prices.
- triangles is quite simple: it randomly generates a large number of triangles. It is quite a lively sight!
- brownian is brownian motion. It supports command line arguments for colour and length.
